Project Description
-------------------

This github directory contains codes, data and reports detailing my
exploratory data analysis and outcome variable prediction for the
[Kaggle Africa Soil Property Prediction Challenge data
set](!https://www.kaggle.com/c/afsis-soil-properties/data). You will
find my reports in markdown and html formats and my codes written in R.
Reports are in the parent directory while codes are in the
*data\_and\_codes* subdirectory.

The quest with this data set is to use data from Diffuse Reflectance
Infrared Spectroscopy to predict soil properties. These properties are
sand content (Sand), Mehlich-3 extractable calcium (Ca), Mehlich-3
extractable phosphorus (P), pH values (pH), and soil organic carbon
(SOC). Diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy is highly repeatable,
rapid and low cost. It involves measurement of the amount of light
absorbed by a soil sample at hundreds of specific wavebands across a
range of wavelengths to provide an infrared spectrum.
